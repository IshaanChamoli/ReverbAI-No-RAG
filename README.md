# Personalized Content Writing Assistant

This content writer chatbot helps users rewrite content with minimal changes, using their own previously written text. It functions as a personalized assistant that adapts its responses based on the amount of user-provided content it has.

When the chatbot has limited information about a user’s style or content, it generates partial answers with placeholders, suggesting specific areas for the user to add their own insights (like anecdotes or specific examples). As the chatbot gains more data on a user’s preferences and writing style, it uses this personalized content database to generate responses that rely on mixing and matching relevant user-provided content.

The chatbot’s goal is to leave the user’s original text as unchanged as possible, only making minor adjustments for grammar and coherence. It saves both the user’s written portions and the initial topics/questions provided, building a tailored, evolving database for each user.
